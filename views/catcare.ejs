                    <h2>Basic Cat Care Tips</h2>
                    <div class="tip-explanation">
                        <h3>1. Nutrition:</h3>
                        <p>Provide your cat with a balanced diet suitable for their age, weight, and health condition.
                            Consult
                            with a veterinarian to determine the best food options, considering factors like protein
                            content,
                            hydration, and avoiding fillers or artificial additives.</p>

                        <h3>2. Exercise:</h3>
                        <p>Ensure your cat stays active to maintain a healthy weight and mental stimulation. Encourage
                            play with
                            interactive toys, laser pointers, or climbing structures. Rotate toys regularly to prevent
                            boredom
                            and promote natural behaviors.</p>

                        <h3>3. Veterinary Care:</h3>
                        <p>Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to monitor your cat's health and detect any
                            potential
                            issues early. Keep vaccinations up-to-date, and discuss preventive measures for parasites
                            such as
                            fleas, ticks, and worms.</p>

                        <h3>4. Grooming:</h3>
                        <p>Establish a grooming routine to keep your cat's coat, nails, ears, and teeth healthy.
                            Brushing
                            reduces shedding and prevents matting, while regular nail trims and dental care contribute
                            to
                            overall well-being.</p>

                        <h3>5. Environmental Enrichment:</h3>
                        <p>Create a stimulating environment with scratching posts, climbing structures, hiding spots,
                            and window
                            perches. Rotate toys and introduce puzzle feeders to engage your cat's natural hunting
                            instincts and
                            prevent boredom.</p>

                        <h3>6. Litter Box Maintenance:</h3>
                        <p>Keep the litter box clean and accessible, scooping waste daily and changing litter regularly.
                            Provide
                            one litter box per cat, plus an extra, and place them in quiet, easily accessible locations
                            away
                            from food and water.</p>

                        <h3>7. Safe Environment:</h3>
                        <p>Remove potential hazards such as toxic plants, electrical cords, and small objects that could
                            be
                            swallowed. Secure windows and balconies, and ensure household cleaners and chemicals are
                            stored
                            safely out of reach.</p>

                        <h3>8. Love and Attention:</h3>
                        <p>Build a strong bond with your cat through daily interaction, playtime, and affection. Respect
                            your
                            cat's boundaries and provide plenty of opportunities for rest and relaxation in comfortable,
                            quiet
                            spaces.</p>
